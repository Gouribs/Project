Terminology

A repository is like a folder, and you work with it as if it were a simple folder. However, it also contains information about all changes made to all files in this folder.

A commit is a record of a change in the repository. It allows you to track the evolution of a file. So, a Git repository, storing initial files and all changes, allows you to view the state of the repository at any moment in time.



Steps to repeat

Initialize repository in the folder with git init.

Add a file to the folder (todolist.txt for example).

Stage added file with git add todolist.txt.

Commit changes with git commit -m “name of commit”.
